##Instructions:
Create an Calculator Android application using the GridLayout. Your calculator should be fully funtional and perform actions correctly. For example, 2 + 2 should equal 4. All arithmetic should be correct, as you would expect from any app you install. The 'C' button should clear the last number entered, but not clear out the current operation. The 'CE' button should clear out the entire current operation. There are two requirements when the phone rotates: 1. All state of the app should be preserved. If I press '2' and a '+' and rotate the phone, I should be able to press '2' and '=' and get 4 back. 2. The layout should change. Notice from the example screenshot that number of rows and columns change whether you are in Portrait or Landscape mode.
